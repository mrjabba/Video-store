Video store
(Chapter 1 of the refactoring book)

Started with the initial version of the video store application from the
Ruby edition of the refactoring book.  Added some initial tests based on
the tests Uncle Bob had in his refactoring video of the video store for
Java.  From there, I applied the same refactoring steps that Uncle Bob
made in Java to the Ruby code.
